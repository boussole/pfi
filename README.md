# Preparation For Interview (pfi)

## About this project
A few years ago I decided to change my current job and try my skills in a big company.

After a deep research of interview approaches I scheduled my preparation.

As you know, my friend, big companies ask at first of all two things:
* algorithms;
* puzzles.

I found a great resource from a microsoft developer Aleksandr B. (https://polycode.livejournal.com/29426.html) which covers MUST HAVE knowledge for interview in a big company.

Thank you Aleksandr, you created a great start point!!!!

I tried to solve tasks from this resourse by myself and than looked for the best solution in internet, so NOT all puzzle solutions in this project have the best solution!!! If you want to see the best solution use another resourses (https://www.topcoder.com/, http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/, https://www.careercup.com/, etc).

And be carefull, my solutions may contain BUGs!!!

Also I tried to implement different algorithms and data structures for design practice.

The next step was training an interview in a real company.

Remember, DON'T start your interview with your goal company, visit another one, this experience will help you in the future.

Some companies give you a task before interview, other give you a task after interview, so my resolutions of this tasks I've also put in this project.

Yes!!!! I changed my job, but I still practice my puzzle resolution skills using `geeksforgeeks` resourse.

Also I put in this project my university time tasks for history :-), sometimes it's funny to see your code after many years.
