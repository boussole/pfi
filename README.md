Preparation For Interview

Warning!!!! It's not an usefull project, this is my preparation for interview.

I did it faster and it may contain BUGs!!!!

Not all problems here have optimal solution, some of them have naive solution only.

So if you need optimal solution use another resourses (like https://www.topcoder.com/, http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/, https://www.careercup.com/, etc)

I'm not going to maintain it!!!

I've saved it here only for history :-)
