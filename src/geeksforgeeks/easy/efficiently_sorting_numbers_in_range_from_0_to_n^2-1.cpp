/*
   Given an array of numbers of size n.
   It is also given that the array elements are in range from 0 to n2 â€“ 1.
   Sort the given array in linear time.

   Input:
   The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
   Then T test cases follow.
   Each test case contains an integer n denoting the size of the array.
   The following line contains n space separated integers.

   Output:
   Sort the given array in linear time.

   Constraints:
   1<=T<=10^5
   1<=n<=10^4
   1<=a[i]<=(10^4)-1

   Example:
   Input:
      2
      7
      40 12 45 32 33 1 22
      5
      24 12 0 15 8

   Output:

How to sort if range is from 1 to n2?
If range is from 1 to n n2, the above process can not be directly applied, it must be changed. Consider n = 100 and range from 1 to 10000. Since the base is 100, a digit must be from 0 to 99 and there should be 2 digits in the numbers. But the number 10000 has more than 2 digits. So to sort numbers in a range from 1 to n2, we can use following process.
1) Subtract all numbers by 1.
2) Since the range is now 0 to n2, do counting sort twice as done in the above implementation.
3) After the elements are sorted, add 1 to all numbers to obtain the original numbers.

How to sort if range is from 0 to n^3 -1?
Since there can be 3 digits in base n, we need to call counting sort 3 times.
